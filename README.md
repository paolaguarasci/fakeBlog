### A Fake blog with CRUD and registration user
the peculiarity of this exercise is that I'm using the libraries but I'm not using any framework or high-level libraries, which do what I need in a few lines of code. I'm trying to keep myself at the lowest level I can. Without falling into the tedium of *_really_doing_everything_by_hand_*.

### Stack
The main components are: **Node**, **Express** (with session and router) and **PostgresSQL** and its driver for node. That's all. sOf course, the security part should be reviewed and probably I will eventually use something like passport.js, but it will still be a next step, with the blog fully functional blog!

### What can i do (now)?
- âœ… read latest 20 post in homepage
- âœ… login using form http://localhost:4000/login
- âœ… add post as logged user at http://localhost:4000/addPost
- âœ… update posts as logged user
- âœ… view my post as logged user
- âœ… click buttons to delete or mod post
- âœ… signup into platform using registration form

### TODO
- make editable user info
- make interface more usable ðŸ¤”
- make registration.html

### Maybe one day...
- Security policy
